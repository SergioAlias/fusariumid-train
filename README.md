 ## ⚙️ 🍄 FUSARIUM-ID Naive Bayes classifiers for QIIME 2

> 🚧 *Work in progress: this pipeline and the pre-computed classifiers will be available soon!*

A workflow to train [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/) taxonomic [Naive Bayes classifiers](https://resources.qiime2.org/#qiime-2-2024-5-present) for the [FUSARIUM-ID database](https://github.com/fusariumid/fusariumid). This database contains sequences of the Translation Elongation Factor 1 alpha (TEF1), which serves as a considerably better marker for species identification in the filamentous fungal genus [*Fusarium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium) than [ITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_transcribed_spacer), the standard marker for all Fungi.
